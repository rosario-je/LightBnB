# Lighthouse BnB

## Overview
Lighthouse BnB is an application designed to provide homeowners with a platform to rent out their properties.

## Project Description
This project involved the development of Lighthouse BnB database management:

- **Database Design and Implementation**: The database schema was designed and implemented using PostgreSQL. An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) was created to define the relationships between tables.

- **Data Seeding**: Dummy data was downloaded and seeded into the database to facilitate testing and query development.

- **Query Writing**: SQL queries were written to interact with the database, covering tasks such as user authentication, reservation management, and property listing retrieval.

- **Backend Integration**: The PostgreSQL database was connected to a JavaScript application, enabling seamless data interaction from a web page.

## Learning Objectives
Throughout this project, I achieved the following learning outcomes:

- Understanding the importance of SQL and relational databases in web application development.
- Proficiency in designing database tables and utilizing primary and foreign keys effectively.
- Ability to write complex SQL queries for data retrieval, manipulation, and aggregation.
- Experience in connecting databases to backend applications using asynchronous PostgreSQL libraries in Node.js.
- Improved problem-solving skills through troubleshooting web development issues and debugging code.
- Practical knowledge in contributing to full-stack web applications using modern software development tools and workflows.

## Functional Requirements
The project covered a series of activities, including:

- Designing the ERD for Lighthouse BnB.
- Setting up the project directory and creating the database schema.
- Seeding the database with dummy data.
- Writing SQL queries for various database interactions.
- Integrating the database with the backend JavaScript application.
- Implementing user authentication and reservation management functionalities.
- Enhancing property listing retrieval with dynamic filtering options.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install PostgreSQL and set up a database named "lightbnb".
3. Run the provided schema file to create the necessary tables.
4. Seed the database with dummy data using the provided seed file.
5. Configure the database connection in the JavaScript application.
6. Begin writing SQL queries and integrating them into the application logic.

## Credits
This project was completed as part of the Relational Databases & SQL module.
